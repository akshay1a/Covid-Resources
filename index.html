<h1>Symptoms</h1>
<p class="a">Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear two to 14 days after exposure. 
This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. 
The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have only a few symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. Some people may experience worsened symptoms, 
such as worsened shortness of breath and pneumonia, about a week after symptoms start.</p>

<section class="causes">
<h1>Causes</h1>
<br>
<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.</p><br>
<p>In some situations, the COVID-19 virus can spread by a person being exposed to small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours — called airborne transmission. It's not yet known how common it is for the virus to spread this way.</p><br>
<p>It can also spread if a person touches a surface or object with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes, but the risk is low.

Some reinfections of the virus that causes COVID-19 have happened, but these have been uncommon.</p><br>
</section>
<section class="prevention">
<h1>Preventions</h1><br>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency use authorization to some COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. A vaccine can prevent you from getting the COVID-19 virus or prevent you from becoming seriously ill if you get the COVID-19 virus. Also, if you are fully vaccinated, you can return to many activities you may not have been able to do because of the pandemic — including not wearing a mask or social distancing — except where required by a rule or law.</p><br>
